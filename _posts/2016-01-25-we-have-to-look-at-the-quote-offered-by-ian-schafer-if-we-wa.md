# Online Marketing in New York:
Is Your Current Local Digital Strategy Obsolete? 

Digital marketing strategies that were effective and popular just a few short years ago might be obsolete the next. One of the favorite ways that we can compare this concept is by using the analogy of a car mechanic. A car mechanic still essentially does the "same job" that they did a decade (they are a car mechanic) but they have to be aware of the changes that are coming out. If a car mechanic does not evolve and keep up with the trends and latest features, they will be left behind in a competitive market. 

Essentially, using a digital marketing strategy that worked a few years ago is like comparing a Ford Model T to a Ford Dodge -- they are the same thing (they are both cars) but they are inherently different and one is far more powerful and efficient than the other. If you let a mechanic who worked on a Ford Model T look at the interior of a new car, chances are that they would not have the slightest clue what they are looking at. 

## How this applies to your marketing strategy 

The same thing is true for digital marketing. Even if your strategy was cutting edge a while back, chances are that everything has passed you by unless you are up-to-date on the latest features and technology. The question then becomes -- do you know what you are looking at when observing your current digital strategy? 

Your online marketing approach that was once heralded as innovative might soon be called old-fashioned, perhaps you will even be called unethical for your traditional marketing appeal. Remember that this is an online world that keeps shifting -- just because something worked in 2013 does not mean that it will work in 2016\.

If you want to market your product or service successfully, you have to be willing to analyze your marketing strategy in an honest way. You are going to have to regularly test new approaches and abandon ineffective techniques. This is one of those situations where the companies who refuse to show a degree of flexibility to adjust to change are going to be left behind by their competitors. New York is a dog-eat-dog market, do you really believe that your competitors are going to be merciful when they are able to capitalize on mistakes in your online marketing in New York efforts? 

If you already have been successful, you have to be willing to leave those obsolete strategies behind in order to attain continued success. If you find that your online strategy is not yielding the desired results, chances are that your marketing strategy is a Ford Model T that has received a shiny new set of rims. It looks nice, but it still the same ineffective machine that is not producing results. 

## Why you have to be willing to evolve

If you want to continue being competitive with your online marketing in New York efforts, you have to be willing to evolve. Even though it might not be what you want to hear (or want to admit), that means that you have to accept that certain parts of the current strategy that you are using have become obsolete. You have to be aware of this (and become willing to accept it) before your competitors do.

If you want to continue to develop your online marketing in New York efforts, you have to be aware that the traditional "set-it-and-forget-it" campaign strategy has become a relic (not unlike the Ford Model T) rather than something that you should safely use.We have to look at the quote offered by Ian Schafer if we want to realize just how important it is that we be flexible in our thinking

> "Innovation needs to be part of your culture. Consumers are transforming faster than we are, and if we don't catch up, we're in trouble." -- Ian Schafer 

Whereas the traditional marketing professional was able to hide behind the concept of: 'half of the marketing budget is wasted; we just do not know which half', we now know that we have more choices than ever before when it comes to determining our success. 

While the traditional marketing concept that focused on segmenting people in large groups, using correct copy, and more, the new marketing strategy requires you to do more than one thing at a time.   
While content to reach your New York audience (and a healthy dose of creativity) is still important, the new factors also require you to be a leading voice with the correct message. 

## Leveling the playing field 

One of the amazing things about today's innovative marketing environment is that even the smaller companies, even startups, have a chance to develop and become one of the leading companies in NYC and then the world. We no longer have to worry about the "big boys" allowing us to play on their field. The digital marketing revolution has made it possible for everyone to make their voices heard -- we just have to be willing to be innovative and explore our opportunities.
